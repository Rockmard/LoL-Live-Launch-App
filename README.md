You've always wondered "How can I get the free esport rewards when I'm not at home" ?
Then this app is made for you.

# A bit of explanation
League of Legends is a very competitive game and the esport scene is very developed.
Thus, proplayers' games are streamed by Riot themselves or other Twitch channels. 
When we log in with our Riot Games account on [lolesports](https://lolesports.com), we can get in-game rewards by watching games.
Here's some examples :

* Hextech Chests

* Exclusive emotes

* Exclusive icons

# How to use it
You have two settings to set up :

* <details> <summary>The league(s) you are planning to watch [(on the left)](https://github.com/Rockmard/LoL-Live-Launch-App/blob/main/README.md#league-of-legends-live-launcher-app)</summary>

  </details>

* At what time does the game start [(on the right)](https://github.com/Rockmard/LoL-Live-Launch-App/blob/main/README.md#league-of-legends-live-launcher-app)
If you don't know when your league is starting, you can press the schedule button.

Once you set it up, you need to click on the "+". If you selected the wrong league, you can select it again but this time time click the "-".
You can check which league(s) you selected by pressing the button just above the start button. 
When you selected all the league(s), just press the start button. The program will stop by itself when all league(s) has been launch.
You can add league while the program is on.

# How it works (not the code itself)
The program saves the leagues with the time you selected. 
Once it's time for the game to start, the lolesports web page opens (! You need to have linked your account before !)
Not every leagues give free rewards so it's no use to start every league if you just want the rewards.
